		<p>My name is Doua Halwa, I’m Palestinian but I never saw Palastine so, I lived my life between Saudi Arabia and Syria. I finished my high school in Saudi Arabia and then I moved to Syria to study computer engineering in Aleppo university and remained there until I met my husband then we married. I have three wonderful boys and we recently got a cat. Because of the war in Syria, we moved to Sweden in 2015.<br>
           since I was studying in university, I always saw myself working as a programmer in the future, but the circumstances around me was always pushing me in other directions. I never forgot my dream to work as a programmer and I hope that moving to Sweden will help me to get a new start to achieve my goals.<br>
           Nowadays, I study Swedish language “Svenska som andra spårk2” in Komvux. In the same time, I am studying a 3 months course in web devolving in Hermods.<br>
           I like to read, walke in the nature and invent new recipes in the kitchen for my family. A while ago, I participated in a voluntary radio program in Mariestad before I moved to Lund. This radio program was a Multilanguage broadcasting program which contains more than 7 languages.</p>
